# Phase 2: Agent Prompt Updates - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Phase 2 implemented comprehensive prompt updates across all five agent nodes to support:
1. **RAG Integration**: Enable `oxytec_knowledge_search` tool for technology constraint retrieval
2. **ATEX De-emphasis**: Position ATEX as a design consideration, not a blocker (installation outside zones)
3. **Maximum Genericity**: Remove case-specific details, support all pollutant types (not just VOCs)

## Files Modified

All changes were made to agent node files in `backend/app/agents/nodes/`:

### 1. EXTRACTOR (`extractor.py`)

**Purpose**: Extract structured facts from uploaded documents
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added **Customer Knowledge & Expectations** section (lines 125-130)
  - Tracks customer's awareness of oxytec/NTP/UV/ozone/scrubbers
  - Captures technology preferences and previous engagements
  - Records customer's technical sophistication level
- ✅ Renamed "VOC Analysis" → **"Pollutant Characterization"** (line 82)
  - Now supports: VOCs, odors, inorganic gases (NH₃, H₂S, SO₂, HCl), particulates, bioaerosols
  - Generic pollutant categories for all industrial exhaust air
- ✅ Enhanced **Data Quality Issues** section (lines 136-141)
  - Required CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW impact classification
  - Flags missing parameters, anomalies, unusual values
  - Estimates uncertainty impact on sizing/design

**Impact**: EXTRACTOR now captures customer context and supports all pollutant types, not just VOCs.

---

### 2. PLANNER (`planner.py`)

**Purpose**: Dynamically create subagent execution plan
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `oxytec_knowledge_search` to **Tools Needed** specification (line 166)
  - Now supports: `oxytec_knowledge_search`, `product_database`, `web_search`, or `none`
- ✅ Added **Example 3: Technology Screening** (lines 133-167)
  - Demonstrates mandatory use of `oxytec_knowledge_search` for technology selection
  - Shows query patterns: "UV ozone removal efficiency [pollutant]", "NTP applications [industry]"
  - Includes scoring matrix and ranked shortlist deliverables
- ✅ Added **CRITICAL PLANNING MANDATES** section (lines 188-214)
  - **A. TECHNOLOGY SELECTION MANDATE**: Always create Technology Screening subagent using `oxytec_knowledge_search`
  - **B. ATEX GUIDANCE**: Position as LOW-MEDIUM risk (equipment outside zones), not HIGH
- ✅ Updated **Common Subagent Types** list (lines 208-216)
  - Added "Technology Screening" as mandatory type with `oxytec_knowledge_search` requirement
  - Added "Safety/ATEX" with context note about outside-zone installation

**Impact**: PLANNER now mandates technology screening via RAG and de-emphasizes ATEX severity.

---

### 3. SUBAGENT (`subagent.py`)

**Purpose**: Execute individual subagent tasks with tools
**Changes**:
- ✅ Updated `extract_tools_from_task()` to support **multiple tools** (lines 40-51)
  - Returns `list[str]` instead of single tool
  - Allows agents to use `oxytec_knowledge_search` + `web_search` simultaneously
- ✅ Added **TOOL USAGE GUIDANCE** to system prompt (lines 101-119)
  - Query strategies for `oxytec_knowledge_search`: broad→specific, application examples, design parameters
  - Cross-referencing: Use RAG first, validate with web_search
  - Best practices: Short queries, multiple attempts, metadata filtering
- ✅ Added **ATEX CONTEXT** to system prompt (lines 121-126)
  - Oxytec typically installs equipment OUTSIDE ATEX zones
  - ATEX is design consideration, not project blocker
  - Frame risk as MEDIUM-LOW unless client requires in-zone installation
- ✅ Added **risk severity classification** requirement (lines 95-96)
  - Subagents must classify challenges as CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
  - Required mitigation strategies for each challenge

**Impact**: SUBAGENTS now leverage RAG effectively and apply appropriate ATEX risk levels.

---

### 4. RISK_ASSESSOR (`risk_assessor.py`)

**Purpose**: Synthesize risks and provide go/no-go decision
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added **ATEX & EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERE CONTEXT** section (lines 54-68)
  - Oxytec's standard practice: Install equipment OUTSIDE ATEX zones
  - Eliminates/reduces ATEX compliance costs and complexity
  - HIGH/CRITICAL classification ONLY if:
    - Client explicitly requires in-zone installation (<20% of cases)
    - Ductwork routing outside zone physically impossible
    - Concentration >25% LEL at equipment location (extremely rare)
  - Typical case: LOW-MEDIUM risk with <€30k cost impact
- ✅ Added **RISK CLASSIFICATION ATEX GUIDANCE** (lines 63-68)
  - LOW (5-10%): Equipment outside zone feasible (typical)
  - MEDIUM (20-30%): Some in-zone sensors/controls; Zone 2 Category 3
  - HIGH (40-60%): Client requires full in-zone installation (+15-25% electrical costs)
  - CRITICAL (>80%): NEVER use for ATEX unless unavoidable constraint
- ✅ Enhanced **MITIGATION STRATEGY CONSOLIDATION** (lines 100-107)
  - Immediate actions, design solutions, operational solutions, phased approach
  - Cost/timeline estimates and risk reduction impact quantification

**Impact**: RISK_ASSESSOR now applies realistic ATEX risk levels based on oxytec's standard practice.

---

### 5. WRITER (`writer.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive German feasibility report
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added **TECHNOLOGY-AGNOSTIC POSITIONING** guidance (lines 86-91)
  - Oxytec is technology-agnostic: offers NTP, UV/ozone, scrubbers, and hybrids
  - State explicitly which technology is MOST suitable
  - **If UV/ozone or scrubbers better than NTP: Clearly communicate this**
  - Justify with technical reasoning (reactivity, water solubility, LEL concerns)
  - Mention hybrid system advantages where applicable
- ✅ Updated section instructions (lines 93-95)
  - First paragraph: Which oxytec technology is MOST suitable and why (explicit)
  - Second paragraph: Chemical/physical considerations and technology-specific advantages

**Impact**: WRITER now positions oxytec as technology-agnostic and clearly states optimal solution (not defaulting to NTP).

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Testing
Test each agent node independently with sample inputs:

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_extractor_node -v
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_planner_node -v
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_subagent_node -v
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_risk_assessor_node -v
pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_writer_node -v
```

### 2. Integration Testing
Test full workflow with diverse inquiry types:

- **VOC case**: Traditional VOC treatment (existing test case)
- **Inorganic case**: NH₃/H₂S scrubber application (new)
- **Odor case**: Food processing odor control (new)
- **ATEX case**: Flammable solvent exhaust (verify LOW-MEDIUM classification)
- **Hybrid case**: Pollutant mix requiring multi-stage treatment (new)

### 3. RAG Tool Validation
Verify `oxytec_knowledge_search` is invoked:

```bash
# Check test_technology_rag.py passes
python backend/scripts/test_technology_rag.py

# Monitor agent execution logs for tool calls
# Expected: PLANNER creates Technology Screening subagent
# Expected: Subagent invokes search_oxytec_knowledge tool
# Expected: Queries like "UV ozone VOC removal", "NTP applications food"
```

### 4. ATEX Risk Classification Audit
Review RISK_ASSESSOR outputs:

- Verify ATEX risks are typically classified as LOW (5-10%) or MEDIUM (20-30%)
- HIGH/CRITICAL classification only when client explicitly requires in-zone installation
- Check mitigation strategies mention "installation outside ATEX zone" as default approach
