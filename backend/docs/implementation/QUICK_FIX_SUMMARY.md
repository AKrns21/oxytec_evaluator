# Subagent Execution Fix - Quick Summary

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Files Modified:** 3
**Risk:** LOW (backward compatible changes)

---

## What Was Broken

Subagents were not executing because Pydantic validation was rejecting the planner's output:
- **Field name mismatch**: Planner outputting `"reasoning"`, validation expecting `"rationale"`
- **Overly strict constraints**: `task` max length 3000 chars (too small for detailed prompts)
- **Hard failure on validation errors**: Empty subagent list → no execution

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Schema Alignment (`validation.py`)
```python
# Added 'reasoning' field to match planner prompt
class PlannerOutput(BaseModel):
    reasoning: Optional[str]  # ← NEW
    rationale: Optional[str]  # ← Kept for compatibility

# Increased task length and removed unused field
class SubagentDefinition(BaseModel):
    task: str = Field(max_length=8000)  # ← Was 3000
    relevant_content: str
    # Removed: tools_needed (not used)
```

### 2. Graceful Degradation (`planner.py`)
```python
# If validation fails but plan has subagents → proceed with warning
# Only block if truly no subagents
except ValidationError as e:
    if plan has subagents:
        logger.warning("proceeding with unvalidated plan")
        return plan + warnings
    else:
        return empty + errors
```

### 3. Better Error Logging (`planner.py`, `subagent.py`)
- Log raw plan preview on validation failure
- Log planner_plan structure when subagents missing
- Validate each subagent definition individually
- Show exactly what fields are missing/wrong

### 4. Enhanced Planner Prompt (`planner.py`)
- Explicitly state validation requirements
- Clarify expected field names
- Add constraints (3-10 subagents, 10-8000 chars)

## Files Changed

1. **`backend/app/agents/validation.py`**
   - Added `reasoning` field to `PlannerOutput`
   - Increased `task` max_length: 3000 → 8000
   - Removed unused `tools_needed` field

2. **`backend/app/agents/nodes/planner.py`**
   - Added graceful degradation on validation failure
   - Enhanced error logging with plan preview
   - Improved prompt with explicit validation requirements

3. **`backend/app/agents/nodes/subagent.py`**
   - Added detailed logging when no subagents found
   - Added structural validation for each definition
   - Enhanced error messages with available keys

---

## Testing

**Quick Test:**
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Upload documents via frontend (http://localhost:3000)
# Check logs for:
✓ "planner_completed_validated" with num_subagents >= 3
✓ "subagents_execution_started"
✓ "subagents_execution_completed" with successful > 0
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Subagents now execute successfully
- If validation issues occur, system logs warnings but continues
- Detailed error messages help diagnose any remaining issues

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert with:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- app/agents/validation.py app/agents/nodes/planner.py app/agents/nodes/subagent.py
```

All changes are backward compatible - old planner outputs with `"rationale"` still validate.
