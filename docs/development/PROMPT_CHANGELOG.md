# Prompt Version Changelog

This document tracks all changes to agent prompts across versions. Each prompt change should be documented here with semantic versioning.

## Versioning Convention

We use **Semantic Versioning** for prompts:
- **MAJOR** (vX.0.0): Breaking changes - output format changes, required field changes, major behavioral shifts
- **MINOR** (vX.Y.0): New features, significant prompt improvements, new instructions without breaking changes
- **PATCH** (vX.Y.Z): Bug fixes, clarifications, small adjustments, typo corrections

##Human: Let me stop you here. Pls create a comprehensive summary of what you implemented so far including usage instructions and next steps
