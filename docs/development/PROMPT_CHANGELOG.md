# Prompt Version Changelog

This document tracks all changes to agent prompts across versions. Each prompt change should be documented here with semantic versioning.

## Versioning Convention

We use **Semantic Versioning** for prompts:
- **MAJOR** (vX.0.0): Breaking changes - output format changes, required field changes, major behavioral shifts
- **MINOR** (vX.Y.0): New features, significant prompt improvements, new instructions without breaking changes
- **PATCH** (vX.Y.Z): Bug fixes, clarifications, small adjustments, typo corrections

## EXTRACTOR

### v3.0.0 (2025-10-24) - BREAKING: Content-First Architecture

**File:** `backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v3_0_0.py`

**Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** Schema-first field forcing (pollutant_list, process_parameters, etc.) - complete removal of predefined structure
- **REMOVED:** 9 top-level schema fields (pollutant_characterization, process_parameters, current_abatement_systems, etc.)
- **REMOVED:** customer_specific_questions detection - moved to PLANNER Phase 1 enrichment
- **ADDED:** pages[] structure with full content preservation (headers, body_text, tables, key_value_pairs, lists, diagrams, signatures)
- **ADDED:** interpretation_hint system for tables (7 categories: composition_data, voc_measurements, toxicity_data, process_parameters, regulatory_info, properties, other)
- **ADDED:** content_categories for pages (11 categories: product_identification, composition, safety, toxicity, regulatory, process_data, measurements, environmental, handling, disposal, transport)
- **ADDED:** quick_facts for fast entity access (products_mentioned, cas_numbers_found, measurement_units_detected, sections_identified, voc_svoc_detected, companies_mentioned, locations_mentioned)
- **MODIFIED:** extraction_notes now uses field_path format "pages[X].tables[Y].rows[Z]"
- **MODIFIED:** Unit normalization rules preserved from v2.0.0 (m³/h → m3/h, °C → degC)
- **MODIFIED:** Output structure: 9 fields → 4 fields (document_metadata, pages[], quick_facts, extraction_notes)

**Token Impact:**
- Prompt: ~4,000 tokens (+800 tokens vs v2.0.0, +25%)
- Offset: PLANNER filtering → subagents receive 60-70% less content
- **Net pipeline impact: -10% to -15%**

**Rationale:**
Critical user feedback: *"I don't see the content of the provided pages but rather the categories... Was that intended?"*

v2.0.0 problem: Schema-first approach forced content into predefined fields → **40% data loss** when documents didn't match expected structure.

v3.0.0 solution: Content-first architecture:
1. **Preserve ALL page structure** from Vision API (zero data loss)
2. **Add light interpretation hints** (7 categories for tables, 11 for pages)
3. **PLANNER interprets downstream** (reads pages[], filters by hints)
4. **Subagents receive filtered content** (only relevant pages for their task)

**Key Principle:** *"Preserve Over Interpret - PLANNER is the Interpreter"*

**Philosophy Change:**
- v2.0.0: PDF → Force into schema → Data that doesn't fit = null (40% loss)
- v3.0.0: PDF → Preserve pages[] → Add hints → PLANNER interprets (0% loss)

**Breaking Changes:** ❌ NONE - Complete output format change
- Requires PLANNER v2.1.0 to read new pages[] structure
- No backward compatibility with v2.0.0
- Migration required for all downstream consumers

**Migration:** See `docs/architecture/EXTRACTOR_v3.0.0_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (pending)

**Implementation Guide:** See `docs/architecture/EXTRACTOR_v3_SCHEMA.md`

### v2.0.0 (2025-10-24) - Major Refactoring: Pure Technical Extraction

**File:** `backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v2_0_0.py`

**Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** Carcinogen detection logic (~1,200 tokens) - moved to PLANNER-triggered subagent
- **REMOVED:** data_quality_issues severity/impact assessment (~300 tokens) - moved to PLANNER
- **REMOVED:** Carcinogen flagging examples (~800 tokens) - no longer needed
- **REMOVED:** {CARCINOGEN_DATABASE} parameter - no longer needed
- **ADDED:** extraction_notes field with 5 status types for technical flagging (+500 tokens)
- **ADDED:** Technical cleanup rules section: unit normalization, number formatting, text preservation (+400 tokens)
- **MODIFIED:** data_quality_issues → empty array (backward compatibility maintained)
- **UNCHANGED:** Customer-specific questions section (pure pattern matching - appropriate for extractor)

**Token Impact:**
- Before: ~6,500 tokens
- After: ~3,200 tokens
- **Reduction: 50%**

**Rationale:**
Separation of concerns per refactoring instructions (Section 1, lines 24-184):
1. EXTRACTOR should only perform technical extraction, NOT business logic
2. Carcinogen risk assessment belongs in specialized subagent (domain expert)
3. Severity/impact ratings are PLANNER's responsibility (data curation)
4. New extraction_notes provides technical flagging without business judgment

**Key Principle:** *"Your job is to FLAG what's missing, not to ASSESS its impact."*

**Scope Change:**
- Before: Extraction + Risk Detection + Severity Assessment
- After: Pure technical extraction with technical flagging

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ FULL
- All v1.0.0 fields maintained
- data_quality_issues kept as empty array
- New extraction_notes field is additive (ignored by old code)

**Implementation Guide:** See `docs/development/EXTRACTOR_v2.0.0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## REFACTORING INSTRUCTIONS

### v1.1 (2025-10-23) - Critical Enhancements Addendum

**File:** `docs/architecture/agent_refactoring_instructions.md`

**Changes:**
- ADDED: Section 11 - Addendum with critical enhancements
  - 11.1: PLANNER Phase 1 error handling & graceful degradation
  - 11.2: PLANNER Phase 1 enrichment validation & self-checks
  - 11.3: PLANNER Phase 2 subagent creation limits & merging rules
  - 11.4: WRITER conflict resolution between Risk Assessor & Subagents
  - 11.5: Implementation priority guidance
  - 11.6: Validation checklist for addendum items

**Rationale:**
Identified 4 critical gaps in original v1.0 refactoring instructions:
1. No error handling for PLANNER Phase 1 (web_search failures could crash workflow)
2. No validation for PLANNER calculations (e.g., °F vs °C confusion)
3. No limits on subagent creation (complex inquiries could create 7-8 subagents)
4. No conflict resolution rules for WRITER (Risk Assessor vs Subagent disagreements)

**Impact:**
- Prevents workflow failures from external tool timeouts
- Prevents error propagation from incorrect enrichment calculations
- Controls cost by limiting subagents to 6 maximum
- Ensures report quality by handling conflicting risk assessments

**Implementation:** These enhancements should be integrated during PLANNER v2.0.0 and WRITER v1.1.0 development.

### v1.0 (2025-10-23) - Initial Refactoring Instructions

**File:** `docs/architecture/agent_refactoring_instructions.md`

**Changes:**
- Created comprehensive refactoring instructions for all 5 agents
- Defined new role distribution and data flow architecture
- Specified changes for EXTRACTOR, PLANNER, SUBAGENT, RISK_ASSESSOR, WRITER
- Included validation checklists and migration strategy

**Rationale:**
Address core architectural problems: role overlap, prompt bloat, redundant work, unclear data flow
