- **Part 3**: Identified issues (10 categories) with detailed explanations
- **Part 4**: Code quality observations (strengths & weaknesses)
- **Part 5**: Cleanup roadmap with 3 phases
- **Part 6**: File organization compliance check
- **Part 7**: Dead code and unused patterns analysis
- **Part 8**: Duplicate code patterns identification

**Read this if you want**: Deep understanding of codebase structure, architectural decisions, detailed issue analysis

**Key findings**:
- 4 orphaned empty directories
- 2-3 potentially unused utility files
- 3 large modules (690, 677, 668 LOC) that could be split
- Minimal test coverage (7 test files, all evaluation-focused)
- Good architecture overall (7.5/10 rating)

### 2. CLEANUP_CHECKLIST_2025-10-22.md
**Actionable cleanup guide** (6.7 KB, quick reference)

Contains:
- Quick reference summary (issues at a glance)
- 6 specific cleanup tasks with detailed steps
- Verification checklist
- Time/difficulty estimates
- Success criteria
- File location quick reference

**Read this if you want**: Step-by-step instructions for cleanup and improvements

**Key tasks**:
- Phase 1 (1 hour): Remove orphaned directories, verify unused files
- Phase 2 (8-10 hours): Add tests, split large modules, consolidate docs
- Phase 3 (ongoing): Standardize patterns, improve coverage

- Good configuration management
- Structured logging infrastructure
- Well-organized React components

### Needs Improvement
- Some large monolithic files
- Limited test coverage (0 unit tests for services)
- Documentation fragmented across multiple locations
- Some duplicate code patterns
