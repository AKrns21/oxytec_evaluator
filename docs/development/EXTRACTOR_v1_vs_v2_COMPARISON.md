# EXTRACTOR v1.0.0 vs v2.0.0 - Side-by-Side Comparison

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Purpose:** Quick visual reference for key differences

---

## High-Level Philosophy

| Aspect | v1.0.0 | v2.0.0 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Primary Role** | Extract data + Assess risks | Extract data only |
| **Business Logic** | ✅ Included (carcinogen detection, severity ratings) | ❌ Removed (pure technical extraction) |
| **Token Count** | ~6,500 tokens | ~3,200 tokens (-50%) |
| **Scope** | Wide (extraction + analysis + judgment) | Narrow (extraction + technical flagging) |
| **Philosophy** | "Extract and evaluate" | "Extract and flag" |

---

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### 1. Carcinogen Detection

#### v1.0.0 ❌
```markdown
**CRITICAL CARCINOGEN & TOXICITY DETECTION:**

You MUST scan all pollutants against the carcinogen database above and flag in data_quality_issues:

**MANDATORY CHECKS:**
1. Check pollutant_list for ANY Group 1/2A carcinogens
2. Check industry_sector for high-risk processes
3. Check for oxidation of alcohols → formaldehyde risk
4. Check for H2S, benzene, or other highly toxic substances

[Full carcinogen database with IARC classifications]
[Detection keywords]
[Escalation rules]
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "data_quality_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "CARCINOGEN: Ethylene oxide (Group 1 IARC)",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "impact_description": "Requires special ATEX considerations...",
      "examples": ["Ethylene oxide mentioned in process description"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### v2.0.0 ✅
```markdown
[Section completely removed - no carcinogen detection]
```

**Why?** Carcinogen risk assessment is business logic, not data extraction. PLANNER v2.0.0 will create a "Carcinogen Risk Specialist" subagent when needed.

---

### 2. Data Quality Issues

#### v1.0.0 ❌
```json
{
  "data_quality_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "CAS numbers not provided for VOCs",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",                          // ❌ Business judgment
      "impact_description": "±10% uncertainty...",   // ❌ Impact assessment
      "examples": ["Duplicate CAS", "unusual value"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem:** Severity rating and impact assessment are PLANNER's responsibility.

#### v2.0.0 ✅
```json
{
  "data_quality_issues": [],  // Empty array for backward compatibility

  "extraction_notes": [        // NEW: Technical flagging without judgment
    {
      "field": "pollutant_list[0].cas_number",
      "status": "missing_in_source",              // ✅ Technical status
      "note": "Ethylacetat mentioned without CAS number"  // ✅ No impact assessment
    }
  ]
}
```

**Improvement:** Pure technical flagging - no business judgment.

---

### 3. Technical Cleanup Rules

#### v1.0.0 ❌
```markdown
5. Unit normalization and formatting:
   - ALWAYS normalize Unicode to ASCII
   - Preserve original decimal separators
   - Complete table structures
   [Basic rules scattered throughout]
```

**Problem:** Rules not comprehensive, no explicit DO NOT instructions.

#### v2.0.0 ✅
```markdown
**TECHNICAL CLEANUP RULES:**

You MUST perform these automatic technical normalizations:

1. **Unit Normalization:**
   - Unicode → ASCII: "m³/h" → "m3/h", "°C" → "degC"
   - Preserve case: "Nm3/h" stays "Nm3/h"
   - Preserve ambiguity: Flag if unclear, don't guess

2. **Number Formatting:**
   - Thousand separators: "1.200" → 1200
   - Decimal separators: Preserve as 1.5
   - Ranges: "10-20%" → keep as string

3. **Text Preservation:**
   - Keep original names: "Ethylacetat" (no translation)
   - Preserve spelling (even errors)

4. **Table Extraction:**
   - Extract ALL rows/columns (use null for empty)
   - Preserve headers and order exactly

5. **CAS Number Extraction:**
   - Extract if present: "CAS: 141-78-6" → "141-78-6"
   - If missing: null (do NOT look up!)
   - If ambiguous: Add extraction_note

**DO NOT:**
- Look up missing CAS numbers (planner's job)
- Translate substance names (planner's job)
- Validate plausibility (planner's job)
- Normalize ambiguous units (flag instead)
```

**Improvement:** Comprehensive, explicit, with DO NOT boundaries.

---

### 4. Extraction Notes

#### v1.0.0 ❌
```markdown
[No extraction_notes concept - everything went into data_quality_issues with severity]
```

#### v2.0.0 ✅
```markdown
**EXTRACTION NOTES:**

When you encounter missing, unclear, or ambiguous data, add a note to extraction_notes:

**Status Types:**
- not_provided_in_documents: Field not mentioned anywhere
- missing_in_source: Mentioned but incomplete
- unclear_format: Present but ambiguous
- table_empty: Table structure exists but cells empty
- extraction_uncertain: Unsure of interpretation

**Examples:**

Document says: "Ethylacetat"
→ {field: "pollutant_list[0].cas_number", status: "missing_in_source", note: "..."}

Document says: "156 kg/Tag"
→ {field: "concentration", status: "unclear_format", note: "Unclear if concentration or daily load"}

**DO NOT:**
- Add severity ratings
- Add impact descriptions
- Make business judgments
- Propose solutions
```

**Improvement:** Technical status types, clear examples, explicit boundaries.

---

### 5. Customer Questions

#### v1.0.0 ✅
```markdown
**CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DETECTION:**

You MUST scan all documents for explicit customer questions...

[Detection patterns]
[Question classification]
[Priority classification]
[Examples]
```

#### v2.0.0 ✅
```markdown
[IDENTICAL - No changes]
```

**Why?** Customer question detection is pure pattern matching - appropriate for extractor, no business logic involved.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Missing CAS Number

**Input Document:**
```
Substanz: Ethylacetat
Konzentration: 450 mg/Nm³
```

**v1.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Ethylacetat", "cas_number": null}],
  "data_quality_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "CAS numbers not provided",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",                           // ❌ Business judgment
      "impact_description": "±10% uncertainty...",    // ❌ Impact assessment
      "examples": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**v2.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Ethylacetat", "cas_number": null}],
  "extraction_notes": [
    {
      "field": "pollutant_list[0].cas_number",
      "status": "missing_in_source",                  // ✅ Technical status
      "note": "Ethylacetat mentioned without CAS"     // ✅ No judgment
    }
  ],
  "data_quality_issues": []
}
```

---

### Scenario 2: Formaldehyde Present (Carcinogen)

**Input Document:**
```
Substanz: Formaldehyd
Konzentration: 15 mg/Nm³
```

**v1.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Formaldehyd", "concentration": 15}],
  "data_quality_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "CARCINOGEN: Formaldehyde (Group 1 IARC)",  // ❌ Risk assessment
      "severity": "CRITICAL",                               // ❌ Business judgment
      "impact_description": "Requires catalytic treatment...",  // ❌ Solution proposal
      "examples": ["Formaldehyde in VOC list"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**v2.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Formaldehyd", "concentration": 15, "concentration_unit": "mg/Nm3"}],
  "extraction_notes": [],                                   // ✅ No flagging
  "data_quality_issues": []
}
```

**What happens to carcinogen risk?**
→ PLANNER v2.0.0 will:
1. See "Formaldehyd" in pollutant_list
2. Trigger "Carcinogen Risk Specialist" subagent
3. Specialist performs comprehensive analysis with web_search
4. More reliable than keyword matching

---

### Scenario 3: Ambiguous Unit

**Input Document:**
```
Volumenstrom: 2800
```

**v1.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "process_parameters": {
    "flow_rate": {"value": 2800, "unit": null}     // No guidance on ambiguity
  },
  "data_quality_issues": []                        // Missing unit not flagged
}
```

**v2.0.0 Output:**
```json
{
  "process_parameters": {
    "flow_rate": {"value": 2800, "unit": null}
  },
  "extraction_notes": [
    {
      "field": "process_parameters.flow_rate.unit",
      "status": "unclear_format",                  // ✅ Technical status
      "note": "Flow rate value provided without unit (m3/h vs Nm3/h unclear)"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Testing (Week 1)

1. Deploy v2.0.0 to staging
2. Run evaluation tests on historical cases
3. Compare outputs with v1.0.0
4. Verify JSON parsing succeeds

### Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 2)

1. Route 25% of sessions to v2.0.0
2. Monitor metrics daily
3. Increase to 50% if no issues
4. Rollback if errors >1%

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 3)

1. Route 100% to v2.0.0
2. Keep v1.0.0 available for rollback
3. Monitor for 1 week
4. Deprecate v1.0.0 if stable

---

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback to v1.0.0 if:

1. **JSON parsing errors** >1%
2. **Field extraction accuracy** drops below 90%
3. **Critical carcinogen missed** (should be caught by PLANNER, but monitor)
4. **Downstream agents fail** due to missing data_quality_issues
5. **User complaints** about data quality

## Key Takeaways

### What Changed

1. ❌ **REMOVED:** Carcinogen detection (business logic)
2. ❌ **REMOVED:** Severity ratings (business judgment)
3. ❌ **REMOVED:** Impact assessments (analysis, not extraction)
4. ✅ **ADDED:** extraction_notes (technical flagging)
5. ✅ **ADDED:** Technical cleanup rules (comprehensive)

### What Stayed

1. ✅ All extraction fields (pollutant_characterization, process_parameters, etc.)
2. ✅ Customer question detection (pure pattern matching)
3. ✅ JSON output format (all v1.0.0 fields maintained)
4. ✅ Unit normalization (enhanced with explicit rules)

### Philosophy Shift

**v1.0.0:** "Extract data and make business judgments about quality/risk"
**v2.0.0:** "Extract data exactly as written, flag technical ambiguities"

**Key Principle:** *"Your job is to FLAG what's missing, not to ASSESS its impact."*
