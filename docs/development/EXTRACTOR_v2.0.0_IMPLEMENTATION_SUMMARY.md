# EXTRACTOR v2.0.0 Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Version:** v2.0.0
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Author:** Claude (Prompt Engineering Specialist)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully created **EXTRACTOR v2.0.0** - a major refactoring that removes ~50% of prompt tokens (~6,500 → ~3,200 tokens) by eliminating business logic and focusing on pure technical data extraction. This is Phase 1 of the 5-agent refactoring project.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New File Created

**Location:** `/Users/Andreas_1_2/Dropbox/Zantor/Oxytec/Industrieanfragen/Repository_Evaluator/backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v2_0_0.py`

**File Size:** ~14 KB
**Token Count:** ~3,200 tokens (down from ~6,500 in v1.0.0)
**Token Reduction:** ~50%

---

## Key Changes Implemented

### ✅ REMOVED (Business Logic)

1. **Carcinogen Detection Section (Lines 450-492 from v1.0.0)**
   - Entire `CARCINOGENIC & HIGHLY TOXIC SUBSTANCES` section
   - Group 1/2A IARC carcinogen lists (formaldehyde, ethylene oxide, benzene, etc.)
   - Detection keywords and automatic escalation rules
   - Expert warning context
   - Example carcinogen flagging JSON with severity ratings
   - **Rationale:** Carcinogen risk assessment is a specialized task that belongs in a PLANNER-triggered subagent, not the extractor

2. **Severity-Based Data Quality Assessment (Lines 182-189 from v1.0.0)**
   - Severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Impact descriptions ("Affects LEL calculations...")
   - Business judgments about importance
   - Examples with business evaluations
   - **Rationale:** Severity rating and impact assessment is the PLANNER's responsibility

3. **CARCINOGEN_DATABASE Parameter**
   - Removed {CARCINOGEN_DATABASE} from line 64 parameter list
   - **Rationale:** No longer needed as carcinogen detection is removed

### ✅ ADDED (Technical Extraction Features)

1. **EXTRACTION NOTES Section**
   - New field: `extraction_notes` array in JSON schema
   - 5 status types for technical flagging:
     - `not_provided_in_documents`: Field not mentioned anywhere
     - `missing_in_source`: Mentioned but incomplete (e.g., substance without CAS)
     - `unclear_format`: Present but ambiguous (e.g., unit unclear)
     - `table_empty`: Table structure exists but cells empty
     - `extraction_uncertain`: Unsure of interpretation
   - **Clear examples** for each status type
   - **DO NOT rules**: No severity ratings, no impact descriptions, no business judgments
   - **Purpose:** Flag technical data issues for PLANNER to resolve

2. **TECHNICAL CLEANUP RULES Section**
   - **Unit Normalization:**
     - Unicode → ASCII: "m³/h" → "m3/h", "°C" → "degC"
     - Preserve case: "Nm3/h" stays "Nm3/h"
     - Preserve ambiguity: Flag if unclear rather than guess
   - **Number Formatting:**
     - Thousand separators: "1.200" → 1200
     - Decimal separators: "1,5" → 1.5
     - Ranges: "10-20%" → keep as string
   - **Text Preservation:**
     - Keep original names: "Ethylacetat" stays "Ethylacetat" (no translation)
     - Preserve spelling (even errors)
   - **Table Extraction:**
     - Extract ALL rows/columns, including empty cells (use null)
     - Preserve headers and row order exactly
   - **CAS Number Rules:**
     - Extract if present: "CAS: 141-78-6" → "141-78-6"
     - If missing: Use null (do NOT look up)
     - If ambiguous: Add extraction_note
   - **DO NOT rules:** No lookups, no translations, no validation, no normalization of ambiguous units

### ✅ MODIFIED (Schema Changes)

1. **JSON Schema Updated**
   ```json
   {
     "extraction_notes": [
       {
         "field": "string (JSON path)",
         "status": "string (5 status types)",
         "note": "string (brief description)"
       }
     ],
     "data_quality_issues": []  // Empty array for backward compatibility
   }
   ```

2. **data_quality_issues Field**
   - Changed to empty array `[]`
   - Kept in schema for backward compatibility
   - Deprecated in favor of `extraction_notes`

### ✅ UNCHANGED (Kept as Valid Extraction Tasks)

1. **Customer-Specific Questions Section (Lines 413-490)**
   - **KEPT COMPLETELY** - Customer question detection is pure pattern matching
   - Detection patterns, classification, priority rules all preserved
   - **Rationale:** This is appropriate for the extractor - no business logic, just text pattern recognition

2. **All Other Extraction Fields**
   - pollutant_characterization
   - process_parameters
   - current_abatement_systems
   - industry_and_process
   - requirements_and_constraints
   - site_conditions
   - customer_knowledge_and_expectations
   - timeline_and_project_phase

## Scope Changes

### Before (v1.0.0): Extraction + Business Logic

- ❌ Extract data
- ❌ Detect carcinogens and assess risk
- ❌ Classify data quality severity
- ❌ Assess impact on design
- ❌ Make escalation decisions

### After (v2.0.0): Pure Technical Extraction

- ✅ Extract data exactly as written
- ✅ Normalize units (Unicode → ASCII)
- ✅ Flag missing/unclear data (no severity)
- ✅ Detect customer questions (pattern matching)
- ✅ Preserve original wording

**Key Principle:** *"Your job is to FLAG what's missing, not to ASSESS its impact."*

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

**1. Review the New Prompt**

```bash
# Read the new prompt file
cat backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v2_0_0.py
```

**2. Compare with v1.0.0**

```bash
# See what was removed/added
diff backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v1_0_0.py \
     backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v2_0_0.py
```

**3. Integration Options**

**Option A: Direct Integration (Recommended for testing)**

Update `backend/app/agents/nodes/extractor.py`:

```python
# OLD:
from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v1_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE

# NEW:
from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v2_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE
```

**Option B: Feature Flag (Recommended for production)**

```python
# app/agents/nodes/extractor.py

from app.config import settings

if settings.EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION == "v2.0.0":
    from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v2_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE
else:
    from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v1_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE
```

Add to `.env`:
```bash
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v2.0.0  # or v1.0.0 for rollback
```

**4. Test the New Prompt**

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run extractor evaluation tests
python3 -m pytest tests/evaluation/extractor/ -v

# Test with specific file
python3 tests/evaluation/extractor/test_single_file.py <filename.xlsx>
```

### For Prompt Engineers

**Understanding the Changes:**

1. **Read the refactoring instructions:**
   - File: `docs/architecture/agent_refactoring_instructions.md`
   - Section 1: EXTRACTOR Changes (lines 24-184)

2. **Review the implementation:**
   - File: `backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_v2_0_0.py`
   - Compare inline comments with refactoring instructions

3. **Check validation:**
   - ✅ No business logic remains
   - ✅ extraction_notes section is clear with examples
   - ✅ Technical cleanup rules are explicit
   - ✅ CAS lookup is explicitly forbidden
   - ✅ Carcinogen detection completely removed
   - ✅ JSON schema includes extraction_notes field

---

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Input Example

**Document:**
```
Substanz: Ethylacetat
Konzentration: 450 mg/Nm³
Temperatur: 45°C
Volumenstrom: 2800 m³/h
```

### v1.0.0 Output (Old)

```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Ethylacetat", "cas_number": null, ...}],
  "data_quality_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "CAS numbers not provided for VOCs",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "impact_description": "±10% uncertainty in reactivity assessment, requires database lookup",
      "examples": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem:** EXTRACTOR is making business judgment ("MEDIUM severity", "±10% uncertainty") - this is PLANNER's job!

### v2.0.0 Output (New)

```json
{
  "pollutant_list": [{"name": "Ethylacetat", "cas_number": null, ...}],
  "process_parameters": {
    "temperature": {"value": 45, "unit": "degC"},
    "flow_rate": {"value": 2800, "unit": "m3/h"}
  },
  "extraction_notes": [
    {
      "field": "pollutant_list[0].cas_number",
      "status": "missing_in_source",
      "note": "Ethylacetat mentioned without CAS number"
    }
  ],
  "data_quality_issues": []
}
```

**Improvement:** EXTRACTOR only flags technical issue (missing CAS), no business judgment. PLANNER will look it up.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/test_extractor_v2.py` (to be created)

```python
def test_extraction_notes_structure():
    """Test that extraction_notes uses correct status types."""
    # Test with missing CAS number
    # Verify extraction_note has: field, status, note
    # Verify status is one of 5 allowed types
    # Verify no severity/impact fields present

def test_no_business_logic():
    """Test that extractor does NOT add severity ratings."""
    # Test with missing data
    # Verify extraction_notes has no "severity" field
    # Verify extraction_notes has no "impact_description" field

def test_unit_normalization():
    """Test Unicode → ASCII unit conversion."""
    # Input: "2800 m³/h", "45°C"
    # Expected: "2800 m3/h", "45 degC"

def test_cas_not_looked_up():
    """Test that CAS numbers are NOT looked up."""
    # Input: Substance without CAS
    # Expected: cas_number: null
    # Expected: extraction_note flagging missing CAS
```

### Integration Tests

**File:** `tests/integration/test_extractor_planner_handoff.py` (to be created)

```python
def test_extractor_output_feeds_planner():
    """Test that PLANNER can consume EXTRACTOR v2.0.0 output."""
    # Run extractor with test document
    # Pass extraction_notes to planner
    # Verify planner performs CAS lookups
    # Verify planner creates enriched_facts
```

### Evaluation Tests

**Use existing framework:**

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest tests/evaluation/extractor/layer2_llm_interpretation/ -v
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ JSON parsing success rate: 100% (no change from v1.0.0)
- ✅ Field extraction accuracy: ≥95% (no change from v1.0.0)
- ✅ extraction_notes populated when data missing: 100%
- ✅ NO severity ratings in extraction_notes: 100%
- ✅ NO carcinogen detection in output: 100%

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after integration:

**1. Immediate Rollback (Code)**

```python
# app/agents/nodes/extractor.py
from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v1_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE  # Revert to v1.0.0
```

**2. Environment Variable Rollback (Feature Flag)**

```bash
# .env
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v1.0.0  # Rollback without code change
```

**3. Partial Rollback (Hybrid)**

If some features work well but others need adjustment:
- Keep extraction_notes (new feature)
- Temporarily restore data_quality_issues population
- Remove carcinogen detection (confirmed improvement)

**4. No Data Loss**

- v2.0.0 is backward compatible (all v1.0.0 fields still present)
- Downstream agents can ignore extraction_notes if not yet updated
- data_quality_issues field maintained (empty) for compatibility

---

## Performance Impact

### Estimated Changes

| Metric | v1.0.0 | v2.0.0 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Prompt Tokens | ~6,500 | ~3,200 | **-50%** |
| Input Tokens (per doc) | ~1,500 | ~1,500 | 0% |
| Output Tokens | ~800 | ~850 | +6% (extraction_notes) |
| **Total Tokens/Request** | **~8,800** | **~5,550** | **-37%** |
| Cost (GPT-5 @ $0.01/1K) | $0.088 | $0.056 | **-36%** |
| Latency | ~8s | ~6s | **-25%** (est.) |

**Cost Savings:** ~$0.032 per document extraction
**At 100 docs/month:** ~$3.20/month savings from EXTRACTOR alone
**At 1000 docs/month:** ~$32/month savings

**Note:** These are estimates. Actual performance should be measured in production.

---

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **PROMPT_CHANGELOG.md**
   - Add EXTRACTOR v2.0.0 entry with changes and rationale

2. **API Documentation**
   - Update `/api/sessions/{id}` response schema
   - Document new `extraction_notes` field
   - Mark `data_quality_issues` as deprecated (but still present)

3. **Developer Guide**
   - Update prompt versioning workflow
   - Add instructions for switching between prompt versions
   - Document testing process for new prompt versions

4. **README.md** (if applicable)
   - Update architecture diagram (if shows agent responsibilities)
   - Note that EXTRACTOR v2.0.0 is "pure extraction" phase

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Downstream Agents Expect data_quality_issues

**Mitigation:**
- v2.0.0 keeps data_quality_issues as empty array (backward compatible)
- PLANNER v2.0.0 will create its own data quality assessment
- Update PLANNER first, then integrate EXTRACTOR v2.0.0

### Risk 2: Carcinogen Detection is Critical

**Mitigation:**
- PLANNER v2.0.0 will trigger "Carcinogen Risk Specialist" subagent when needed
- This is MORE reliable than EXTRACTOR keyword matching
- Specialist subagent has access to web_search for up-to-date IARC classifications

### Risk 3: extraction_notes Not Actionable

**Mitigation:**
- PLANNER v2.0.0 is designed to consume extraction_notes
- Phase 1 enrichment explicitly resolves flagged issues
- If PLANNER not updated, extraction_notes are simply ignored (no breaking change)

---

## Success Metrics

**Measure after 2 weeks in production:**

1. **Token Efficiency**
   - Actual token reduction ≥30% (target: 37%)
   - Cost reduction ≥25%

2. **Output Quality**
   - JSON parsing success rate ≥99%
   - Field extraction accuracy ≥95%
   - extraction_notes populated when expected: ≥90%

3. **Downstream Impact**
   - PLANNER successfully enriches data flagged in extraction_notes: ≥80%
   - No critical data missed (compared to v1.0.0): 100%

4. **Error Rate**
   - Errors due to prompt change: <1% of sessions
   - Rollback required: NO

---

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why remove carcinogen detection if it's critical?

**A:** Carcinogen detection is NOT removed - it's **moved to a specialist subagent** created by the PLANNER. This is MORE reliable because:
- Specialist has access to web_search for up-to-date IARC data
- Can perform deep analysis (oxidation pathways, formation risks)
- Only created when triggers detected (efficiency)
- EXTRACTOR's keyword matching was error-prone (false positives/negatives)

### Q: What if a document has carcinogens and v2.0.0 misses them?

**A:** The PLANNER v2.0.0 will:
1. Analyze industry_sector (e.g., "petroleum", "ethoxylation")
2. Analyze pollutant_list (e.g., substance names, VOC list)
3. Trigger "Carcinogen Risk Specialist" subagent based on keywords
4. Specialist performs comprehensive analysis with web_search

This is MORE robust than EXTRACTOR's approach.

### Q: Backward compatibility with existing sessions?

**A:** Fully backward compatible:
- v2.0.0 output includes all v1.0.0 fields
- data_quality_issues maintained as empty array
- New extraction_notes field is additive (ignored by old code)

### Q: Can we A/B test v1.0.0 vs v2.0.0?

**A:** Yes, using feature flag approach:
```python
if session.use_extractor_v2:
    from extractor_v2_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE
else:
    from extractor_v1_0_0 import PROMPT_TEMPLATE
```

Route 50% of sessions to each version, compare metrics after 1 week.
