### 1.4 Critical Enhancements (Addendum v1.1)

#### Enhancement 1: Error Handling & Graceful Degradation (11.1)

**Problem:** PLANNER Phase 1 web_search timeouts could crash workflow

**Solution:**
```python
async def enrich_cas_numbers(pollutant_list: list) -> tuple[list, list, list]:
    """Enrich CAS numbers with graceful error handling."""
    enrichment_notes = []
    data_uncertainties = []

    for i, pollutant in enumerate(pollutant_list):
        if pollutant.get("cas_number") is None:
            try:
                cas_result = await web_search_with_retry(
                    query=f"{pollutant['name']} CAS number",
                    max_retries=1,
                    timeout=10
                )
                if cas_result:
                    pollutant["cas_number"] = cas_result
                    enrichment_notes.append({
                        "field": f"pollutant_list[{i}].cas_number",
                        "action": "looked_up",
                        "source": "web_search: PubChem",
                        "confidence": "HIGH"
                    })
            except TimeoutError:
                # Graceful degradation - continue with next pollutant
                data_uncertainties.append({
                    "field": f"pollutant_list[{i}].cas_number",
                    "uncertainty": "CAS lookup failed - network timeout",
                    "impact": "Subagents cannot access chemical databases"
                })
                continue  # Continue with next pollutant
```

**Impact:** Prevents workflow crashes, enables partial success strategies

#### Enhancement 2: Enrichment Validation & Self-Checks (11.2)

**Problem:** PLANNER calculations could propagate errors (°F vs °C confusion → 30% sizing error)

**Solution:**
```python
def normalize_flow_rate(flow_rate_m3h: float, temp_celsius: float, pressure_bar: float = 1.013) -> dict:
    """Normalize flow rate with validation."""
    # Reasonableness check
    if temp_celsius < -50 or temp_celsius > 200:
        return {
            "result": None,
            "confidence": "LOW",
            "error": f"Temperature {temp_celsius}°C outside typical range - verify unit"
        }

    conversion_factor = 273.15 / (273.15 + temp_celsius)
    if not (0.5 < conversion_factor < 1.5):
        confidence = "LOW"
        warning = "Conversion factor unusual - verify temperature unit"
    else:
        confidence = "HIGH"
        warning = None

    normalized = flow_rate_m3h * conversion_factor

    return {
        "result": normalized,
        "confidence": confidence,
        "warning": warning,
        "original_value": flow_rate_m3h,
        "original_unit": "m³/h"
    }
```

**Impact:** Prevents error propagation, adds confidence levels to all calculations

#### Enhancement 3: Subagent Creation Limits & Merging Rules (11.3)

**Problem:** Complex inquiries could create 7-8 subagents (cost explosion)

**Solution:**
```python
def apply_subagent_limits(triggered_subagents: list, max_subagents: int = 6) -> tuple[list, list]:
    """Apply merging rules when >6 subagents triggered."""
    if len(triggered_subagents) <= max_subagents:
        return triggered_subagents, []

    merged_subagents = triggered_subagents.copy()
    reasoning = [f"Triggered {len(triggered_subagents)} subagents (max: {max_subagents})"]

    # Priority 1: Merge Safety/ATEX + Carcinogen Risk
    safety_atex = find_subagent(merged_subagents, "Safety & ATEX Compliance Expert")
    carcinogen = find_subagent(merged_subagents, "Carcinogen Risk Assessment Specialist")

    if safety_atex and carcinogen:
        if carcinogen.get("expected_findings", {}).get("severity") in ["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]:
            merged = create_merged_specialist(safety_atex, carcinogen, name="Health & Safety Expert")
            merged_subagents.remove(safety_atex)
            merged_subagents.remove(carcinogen)
            merged_subagents.append(merged)
            reasoning.append("Merged Safety/ATEX + Carcinogen Risk (high severity)")

    # Return ≤6 subagents
    return merged_subagents[:max_subagents], reasoning
```

**Impact:** Controls costs while maintaining coverage, clear merging priorities

#### Enhancement 4: Conflict Resolution Protocol (11.4)

**Problem:** WRITER had no rules for handling Risk Assessor vs Subagent disagreements

**Solution:**
```python
def detect_conflicts(risk_assessor_output, subagent_results):
    """Detect when Risk Assessor disagrees with Subagents."""
    conflicts = []

    for cross_risk in risk_assessor_output.get("cross_functional_risks", []):
        ra_severity = cross_risk["combined_severity"]
        ra_confidence = cross_risk.get("confidence", "MEDIUM")

        for subagent in subagent_results:
            for finding in subagent.get("findings", []):
                subagent_severity = finding.get("severity")
                subagent_confidence = finding.get("confidence")
                severity_gap = severity_to_number(ra_severity) - severity_to_number(subagent_severity)

                if abs(severity_gap) >= 2:  # 2+ level difference
                    conflicts.append({
                        "risk_topic": cross_risk["risk_title"],
                        "ra_severity": ra_severity,
                        "ra_confidence": ra_confidence,
                        "subagent_severity": subagent_severity,
                        "subagent_confidence": subagent_confidence,
                        "resolution": resolve_conflict(ra_confidence, subagent_confidence)
                    })

    return conflicts
```

**Impact:** Ensures report quality, transparency in disagreements, no hidden conflicts

## 5. Monitoring and Validation

### Check Current Versions
```sql
-- Which versions are currently deployed?
SELECT agent_type, prompt_version, COUNT(*)
FROM agent_outputs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY agent_type, prompt_version;
```

### Monitor Performance
```sql
-- Error rate by version
SELECT
  agent_type,
  prompt_version,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as error_rate_pct
FROM agent_outputs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY agent_type, prompt_version;

-- Average duration and token usage
SELECT
  agent_type,
  prompt_version,
  AVG(duration_seconds) as avg_duration_sec,
  AVG(token_usage) as avg_tokens
FROM agent_outputs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY agent_type, prompt_version;
```

### A/B Testing
```bash
# Compare two versions
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests with v1.0.0
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v1.0.0 python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_extractor.py -v

# Run tests with v2.0.0
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v2.0.0 python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_extractor.py -v

# Generate comparison report
python3 scripts/compare_versions.py extractor v1.0.0 v2.0.0
```

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ImportError: No module named extractor_v2_0_0"

**Cause:** Version file doesn't exist

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if version file exists
ls backend/app/agents/prompts/versions/extractor_*.py

# If missing, create it
cd backend/app/agents/prompts/versions
cp extractor_v1_0_0.py extractor_v2_0_0.py

# Verify import
python3 -c "from app.agents.prompts.versions.extractor_v2_0_0 import PROMPT; print('✅ Import successful')"
```

### Issue: "Config updated but agent still uses old version"

**Cause:** Server not restarted

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart server to reload config
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Or use environment variable override
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v2.0.0 uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Verify version in use
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health | jq '.prompt_versions'
```

### Issue: "Need to rollback to previous version"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Edit config
# backend/app/config.py: extractor_prompt_version = "v1.0.0"

# 2. Restart server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 3. Document rollback in CHANGELOG
echo "ROLLBACK: v2.0.0 → v1.0.0 (reason: [explain])" >> docs/development/PROMPT_CHANGELOG.md

# 4. Monitor for 1 hour to ensure stability
watch -n 60 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health | jq ".prompt_versions"'
```

### Issue: "Tests failing with new version"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check if fixtures need updating
ls tests/fixtures/extractor/

# 2. Generate new fixtures
python3 tests/generate_fixtures.py extractor v2.0.0

# 3. Run tests with verbose output
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_extractor.py -vv

# 4. If critical: rollback to v1.0.0
# Edit config: extractor_prompt_version = "v1.0.0"

# 5. Debug offline
EXTRACTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v2.0.0 python3 debug_extractor.py
```

- **Rationale:** Separates data enrichment (PLANNER does) from delegation (SUBAGENTS do)
- **Impact:** Prevents subagents from wasting tokens on CAS lookups
- **Alternative considered:** Subagents do their own enrichment (rejected: redundant work)

**Decision 2: Maximum 6 Subagents with Merging Rules**
- **Rationale:** Controls costs while maintaining coverage
- **Impact:** Complex inquiries won't explode to 8+ subagents
- **Alternative considered:** No limits (rejected: cost explosion risk)

**Decision 3: RISK_ASSESSOR as Cross-Functional Synthesizer**
- **Rationale:** Focus on interaction risks that subagents miss
- **Impact:** No more redundant technical deep-dives
- **Alternative considered:** Keep as reviewer (rejected: role overlap)

**Decision 4: Trust Hierarchy for WRITER**
- **Rationale:** Clear precedence rules when sources disagree
- **Impact:** Consistent report quality, no hidden conflicts
- **Alternative considered:** Let WRITER decide arbitrarily (rejected: inconsistent)

### 8.2 Implementation Decisions

**Decision 1: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)**
- **Rationale:** Industry standard, clear upgrade path
- **Impact:** Easy rollbacks, A/B testing, gradual migration
- **Alternative considered:** Date-based versioning (rejected: no semantic meaning)

**Decision 2: File-Based Version Storage**
- **Rationale:** Git-friendly, code review, diff-able
- **Impact:** Easy to track changes, no database dependency
- **Alternative considered:** Database storage (rejected: harder to review)

**Decision 3: Graceful Degradation for PLANNER Phase 1**
- **Rationale:** Partial success better than total failure
- **Impact:** Workflow continues even if CAS lookup times out
- **Alternative considered:** Fail fast (rejected: too fragile)

**Decision 4: Confidence Levels for Enrichment**
- **Rationale:** Quantify uncertainty in calculations
- **Impact:** Downstream agents know when to double-check
- **Alternative considered:** No confidence tracking (rejected: error propagation risk)

### High-Impact Risks (Addressed)

✅ **RISK 1: PLANNER Phase 1 crashes on timeout**
- **Mitigation:** Enhancement 11.1 (graceful degradation)
- **Status:** Addressed with retry logic + partial success

✅ **RISK 2: Temperature unit confusion (°F vs °C)**
- **Mitigation:** Enhancement 11.2 (validation)
- **Status:** Addressed with reasonableness checks

✅ **RISK 3: Cost explosion from too many subagents**
- **Mitigation:** Enhancement 11.3 (6 subagent limit)
- **Status:** Addressed with merging rules

✅ **RISK 4: Hidden conflicts in final reports**
- **Mitigation:** Enhancement 11.4 (conflict resolution)
- **Status:** Addressed with transparency protocol

### Moderate Risks (Monitoring Required)

⚠️ **RISK 5: Breaking changes cause test failures**
- **Mitigation:** A/B testing, rollback procedures
- **Status:** Monitoring plan in place

⚠️ **RISK 6: Token usage increases unexpectedly**
- **Mitigation:** Database monitoring, usage alerts
- **Status:** Metrics tracked in production

⚠️ **RISK 7: Engineer satisfaction decreases**
- **Mitigation:** Feedback sessions, validation studies
- **Status:** Week 4 feedback session planned

### Low Risks (Acceptable)

✓ **RISK 8: Migration takes longer than 5 weeks**
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout allows flexibility
- **Impact:** Low - can extend timeline if needed

✓ **RISK 9: Some prompts need PATCH updates**
- **Mitigation:** Versioning system supports rapid iteration
- **Impact:** Low - PATCH versions easy to deploy
